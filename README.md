# commandLineWordGuessGame

This is a Node.js game that works just like Hangman. A director will be randomly selected from a bank of directors. You will then have 10 chances to guess all of the letters and reveal the name of the director. 

This app can be useful for quick info on my latest tweets, detailed song info from Spotify on any song you choose, or detailed info on any movie you choose. 

To get started, follow these steps:
1. clone the app
1. Navigate to the folder in the command line
1. Run npm install to install all necessary dependencies
